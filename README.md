## ReadMe
As for libraries, we used the javascript library with Geo.path for the world map. When creating the node/force graph, we used a force directed algorithm and had the forces between the elements set to be attracted to the center of gravity and repel one another. The rest of the code is from what we were able to learn in class and from the previous assignments. 


The README file must give an overview of what you are handing in: which parts are your code, which parts are libraries, and so on. The README must also explain any non-obvious features of your interface.
